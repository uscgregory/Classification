# Predicting In-Vehicle Coupon Acceptance/Rejection Rate
The goal of this binary classification project is to predict whether or not a person will accept a coupon that is recommended to them in different driving scenarios. This survey describes different driving scenarios including the destination, current time, weather, passenger, etc., and then ask the person whether he will accept the coupon if he is the driver.

The data was collected via a survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk.  The dataset can be found at the UCI Machine Learning Repository.  The link to the dataset is [here.](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/in-vehicle+coupon+recommendation)

***This project is a work-in progress.  Expected completion of this project is 3/18/22***

Please review the final results of my analysis by reviewing the Classification Results - Executive Summary [Coming Soon]

In the course of this project I performed the following analysis:

[Data Cleaning and Exploratory Analysis](https://github.com/uscgregory/Classification/blob/main/Classification%20-%20Data%20Cleaning%20%26%20Analysis.ipynb)
* Identify and Treat Missing Data
* Label Encoding for Ordinal Categorical Data
* Dummy Variable Encoding for Non-Ordinal Categorical Data

[Logistic Regression Model - Coming Soon]()
* Logistic Regression Model
* Feature Selection using RFE and XGBoost
* ROC and CAP Evaulations

[Alternative Models](https://github.com/uscgregory/Classification/blob/main/Classification%20-%20Alternative%20Models.ipynb)
